                <img src="images/lettuce.png" alt="Bass Boosted" class="product"/>
                <p>Sunday Lettuce was a surprisingly good emulation of satarical newspapers, mainly The Onions. Readers get to know about the daily lives of vegetables, as well as the economic and sociopolitical insight of the green planet. The issues of Sunday Lettuce were given at Nord Anglia International School Hong Kong's spring fair as a freshly printed A3 paper, served beside the delicious cups of carrot juice.</p>
